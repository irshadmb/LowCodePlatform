**Low-Code/No-Code, Digital Process Automation(DPA)**

Low-code / no-code workflow and DPA platforms, in particular, enable you
to totally automate business processes and workflows without any
programming knowledge.

Software development teams, and information technology (IT) groups in
general, are under a lot of pressure and have very little time. Business
units require more efficiency and the automation of internal procedures,
but IT has no resources to assist them. Low-code / no-code platforms
make it simple for business people to develop apps without having to
know how to code or rely on IT.

What is low-code/no-code

Low-code/no-code platform will take care of technical challenges and
make it easy for business people to develop apps with less / without
programming knowledge.

-   Enable business people for faster development and evolution of apps.
    As a result, the company can adapt to internal and external demands
    more rapidly.

-   By utilising less hours of often costly professions like Software
    developers, UI designer etc.

-   More applications may be created per unit of time, resulting in
    higher productivity.

-   Faster digital transformation, with simpler acceptance of new
    digital applications in less time.

-   Low-code/no-code platform are simple and easy to adopt. Because
    business person don\'t have to know how to code, making
    modifications is simple and quick.

-   Because applications are prototyped and verified faster, deviations
    may be discovered in real time, lowering the chance of failure.
    Corrections are also more affordable.

-   It enhances the client experience by eliminating the need to wait
    months for a new application and allowing for much faster
    implementation of enhancements.

**Low-code/no-code depends on following which makes it less
programming**

1.  Defining the data storage structure

2.  In a suitable notation, draw the process flow.

3.  Deploying the process in place and moving into production.

**Define and store data without programming**

Every business operation has data connected with it that must be saved.
For eample, Leave approval process flow have to store some basic
information like employee name, leave start date, leave end date, no of
days & leave type etc.

A form designer with in low-code/no-code platform makes it more powerful
to get the data from user. You may use this tool to drag and drop
different fields into a form, which will centralized all necessary data.

**Draw a business process workflow**

The workflow must then be defined (process flow). The graphical
notations for doing it have changed a lot since the historical flow
diagrams.

A business user can create their process using low-code / no-code
workflow and BPM systems, by drag and drop. One can specify a process in
minutes and leave it well-documented this way.

**Deploy process workflow as a low-code/no-code app**

This approach is substantially enabled by low-code / no-code platforms.
Essentially, it allow the process to be deployed and made available to
end-users by clicking a single button. All of the complexity must be
resolved in a transparent manner by the platform. It must create an
internal structure to hold the data, understand the process diagram, and
verify permissions, among other things.

Business units may use low-code / no-code platforms to create workflow
and BPM apps without having to programme. With a press a button to
"Deploy the Process" and utilise it. That\'s where low-code and
no-code process tools shine.
